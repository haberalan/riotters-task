# riotters-task

I made a simple backend because I couldn't fetch the data on frontend.

## Installation

Remember to create your own API_KEY in ./backend/.env

```
git clone git@github.com:haberalan/riotters-task.git
```

```
cd riotters-task
```

```
cd frontend
```

```
npm install
```

```
npm run serve
```

```
cd ../backend
```

```
npm install
```

```
npm start
```
